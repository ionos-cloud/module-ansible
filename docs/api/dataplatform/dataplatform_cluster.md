# dataplatform_cluster

This is a simple module that supports creating or removing Data Platform Clusters. This module has a dependency on ionoscloud &gt;= 6.0.2

## Example Syntax


```yaml

  - name: Create Data Platform cluster
    dataplatform_cluster:
      name: "{{ cluster_name }}"
  

  - name: Update Data Platform cluster
    dataplatform_cluster:
      cluster: "89a5aeb0-d6c1-4cef-8f6b-2b9866d85850"
      maintenance_window:
        day_of_the_week: 'Tuesday'
        time: '13:03:00'
      dataplatform_version: 1.17.8
      state: update
  

  - name: Delete Data Platform cluster
    dataplatform_cluster:
      cluster: "a9b56a4b-8033-4f1a-a59d-cfea86cfe40b"
      state: absent
  
```
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# state: **present**
```yaml
  
  - name: Create Data Platform cluster
    dataplatform_cluster:
      name: "{{ cluster_name }}"
  
```
### Available parameters for state **present**:
&nbsp;

  | Name | Required | Type | Default | Description |
  | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | name | True | str |  | The name of your cluster. Must be 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. |
  | dataplatform_version | False | str |  | The version of the DataPlatform. |
  | datacenter_id | True | str |  | The UUID of the virtual data center (VDC) the cluster is provisioned. |
  | maintenance_window | False | dict |  | Starting time of a weekly 4 hour-long window, during which maintenance might occur in hh:mm:ss format |
  | do_not_replace | False | bool | False | Boolean indincating if the resource should not be recreated when the state cannot be reached in another way. This may be used to prevent resources from being deleted from specifying a differentvalue to an immutable property. An error will be thrown instead |
  | api_url | False | str |  | The Ionos API base URL. |
  | username | False | str |  | The Ionos username. Overrides the IONOS_USERNAME environment variable. |
  | password | False | str |  | The Ionos password. Overrides the IONOS_PASSWORD environment variable. |
  | token | False | str |  | The Ionos token. Overrides the IONOS_TOKEN environment variable. |
  | wait | False | bool | True | Wait for the resource to be created before returning. |
  | wait_timeout | False | int | 600 | How long before wait gives up, in seconds. |
  | state | False | str | present | Indicate desired state of the resource. |
