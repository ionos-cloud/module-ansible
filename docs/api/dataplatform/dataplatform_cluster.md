# dataplatform_cluster

This is a simple module that supports creating or removing Data Platform Clusters. This module has a dependency on ionoscloud &gt;= 6.0.2

⚠️ **Note:** Data Platform is currently in the Early Access (EA) phase. We recommend keeping usage and testing to non-production critical applications. Please contact your sales representative or support for more information.

## Example Syntax


```yaml

  - name: Create Data Platform cluster

### Available parameters for state **present**:
&nbsp;

  | Name | Required | Type | Default | Description |
  | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | name | True | str |  | The name of your cluster. Must be 63 characters or less and must begin and end with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. |
  | dataplatform_version | False | str |  | The version of the data platform. |
  | datacenter | True | str |  | The UUID of the virtual data center the cluster is provisioned. |
